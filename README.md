# Machine Learning Based WAF for Signatures and Anomaly Detection Using Feature Extraction

## Overview

This project develops a Machine Learning-based Web Application Firewall (WAF) that integrates signature-based and anomaly-based detection methods. Using feature extraction techniques, the system accurately detects known and unknown web attacks by analyzing traffic and request data, enhancing the security of web applications with intelligent automated threat identification.

## Features

- Signature-based detection for known attack patterns
- Anomaly-based detection to identify unknown or novel attacks
- Feature extraction to highlight critical patterns for detection
- Machine learning classifiers for accurate threat classification
- Real-time monitoring and alerting of web threats

## Technologies Used

- Python programming language
- Machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn (modify as per your project)
- Feature extraction and data preprocessing tools
- Network traffic analysis

## Project Structure

- `data/` - Datasets for training and testing
- `scripts/` - Scripts for feature extraction, model training, and testing
- `models/` - Saved machine learning models
- `src/` - Source code for deployment and detection logic
- `README.md` - This documentation file

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/PV-AKSHAYA/Machine-learning-based-WAF-for-signatures-and-anomaly-detection-using-feature-extraction.git

2. Go into the project directory:
cd Machine-learning-based-WAF-for-signatures-and-anomaly-detection-using-feature-extraction

3. (Optional) Set up and activate a virtual environment:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate

4. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage

- Prepare or use the included datasets.
- Run the feature extraction:
python scripts/feature_extraction.py --input data/raw_data.csv --output data/features.csv

- Train the detection model:
python scripts/train_model.py --data data/features.csv --model_output models/waf_model.pkl

- Deploy or test the WAF with input data:
python src/detect.py --model models/waf_model.pkl --input traffic_sample.txt


## Results

The system effectively identifies web application attacks leveraging combined detection methods and machine learning. Detailed analysis and performance metrics are provided in the documentation or results folder.
